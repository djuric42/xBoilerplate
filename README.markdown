xBoilerplate
==================================

xBoilerplate was built to kickstart the development of small dynamic webpages. It can also be used to design
websites or web applications directly in css 3. xBoilerplate is inspired by [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and lots of code is copied from HTML5 Boilerplate. The main difference is that xBoilerplate allows dynamic pages with PHP and includes dynamic libraries like lessphp.


Getting Started
---------------
To get you started as fast as possible, xBoilerplate uses Vagrant. The only thing you have to do to setup
the project and have it running in Apache is to execute vagrant up. Sure, you have to
[install vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html) first.


Documentation

Should follow soon
